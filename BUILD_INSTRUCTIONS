Threadly uses gradle to handle it's building, unit testing, and javadoc generation.  This should make compiling on your own system very easy.

Use this documentation to download and install gradle: http://www.gradle.org/get-started

Once gradle is installed, you can compile (and run unit tests) simply by running:
gradle build
the compiled jar is located at: build/libs/
javadocs are located at: build/docs/javadoc/
unit test results are located at: build/reports/tests/
unit test coverage results are located at: build/reports/emma/
