Threadly uses gradle to handle it's building, unit testing, and javadoc generation.  This should make compiling on your own system very easy.

Use this documentation to download and install gradle: http://www.gradle.org/get-started

Once gradle is installed, you can compile (and run unit tests) simply by running:
gradle build
the generated jar file is then located at build/libs/

javadoc can be generated by running:
gradle javadoc
Java docs are then located at build/docs/javadoc/
